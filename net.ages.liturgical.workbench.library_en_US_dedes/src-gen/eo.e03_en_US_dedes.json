So they were upbraided for their hardness of heart. But once they were fully equipped with the signs and miracles, they were sent out to preach. So then You, O Lord, were taken up to Your Father, the Source of Light; and they went and preached the word everywhere, and were confirmed by the miracles. Therefore we, who have been enlightened by them, glorify Your resurrection from the dead, O Lord who loves humanity.'}
