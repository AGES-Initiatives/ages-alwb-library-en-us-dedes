For they have been offered by Your servants to Your glory, in honor and memory of [Saint's Name], and for a memorial to those who have fallen asleep in the true Faith. O Good One, grant to those who have prepared this offering, and to those who keep this memorial, all their requests that are for their salvation, and count them worthy to rejoice in Your eternal blessings; by the intercessions of our all-immaculate Lady Theotokos and every-virgin Mary, of [Saint's Name] whose memory we celebrate, and all Your saints. For You are the One who blesses and sanctifies all things, O Christ our God, we send up glory to You and Your unoriginate Father and Your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and ever and to the ages of ages.'}

When He came to Jerusalem to His voluntary Passion, the people, living in darkness and the shadow of death, taking up the symbols of victory, boughs of trees and palm branches, foretold the Resurrection. Master, as we, too, imitating them, carry Palms and branches on this eve of the feast, watch over us. And as we offer You Hosanna, like those multitudes and the children, safeguard us, so that in hymns and spiritual songs we, too, may worthily witness the lifegiving Resurrection on the third day, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with Whom You are blessed, together with Your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.'}
