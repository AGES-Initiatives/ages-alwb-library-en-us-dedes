Then He called her, and then she knew * that it was the Savior himself. And she heard, * "Touch me not. To my brothers tell * that I go to the Father."'}

Behold, she was counted worthy of having angels teach her, and of laying eyes on You, O Jesus. But her thinking was still mundane, weak woman that she was. And that is why she was sent away and not allowed to touch You, O Christ. Nevertheless, she was sent as a herald to Your Disciples; and she spoke to them the good tidings, and announced that You were ascending to Your Father. Count us, with her, worthy of Your appearance, O Master and Lord.'}
