But You quieted the agitation of their souls by showing them Your hands and Your feet. And while they still did not believe it, You partook of the food and reminded them of the teachings, and thus You opened their minds to understand the Scriptures. Then, when You affirmed the promise of the Father, and You blessed them, You departed for heaven. We therefore join them in worshipping You. Glory to You, O Lord.'}
