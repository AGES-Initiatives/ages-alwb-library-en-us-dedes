For the light of knowledge of Your only-begotten Son has shined in our hearts; since, for our sakes, He revealed Himself upon earth, and dwelt among men; and unto as many as accepted Him He gave the power to become children of God, granting us the adoption of sonship through the laver of regeneration, and setting us free from the oppression of the devil.

O Lord, Grant that this oil becomes the oil of gladness, the oil of sanctifiÂ­cation, a royal robe, an armor of might, the deflecting of every satanic assault, the seal of immunity from snares, the gladness of heart, everlasting joy; that also in this, they who shall be anointed with this oil of rebirth may be strong against their adversaries, and may shine in the radiance of Your Saints, having neither spot nor wrinkle, and that they may be admitted into Your eternal rest, and receive the award of the calling from above.'}

For the salvation of sinners, though being God, You became a created being for the sake of Your creatures. You have said: "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." You sought the wandering sheep; You searched diligently for the lost coin, and having found it, You said: "He that comes to me I will not cast out." You did not abhor the sinful woman who washed Your precious feet with her tears; You said: "As often as you fall, get up, and you shall be saved." It is You, who said: "There is joy in heaven over one sinner who repents." O merciful Master, look down from on High, giving us, Your sinful and unworthy servants, shelter under the grace of the Holy Spirit in this hour; and take up Your abode in these Your servants, who acknowledge their iniquities and draw near to You in faith. Accept them because of Your love towards mankind, forgiving them whatever they have done amiss, whether by word, deed, or thought, and cleanse them from every sin; and abiding ever present with them, preserve them for the remaining years of their life, that, walking ever in Your statutes, they may in no way again become an object of joy to the devil; so that also in these, Your all-holy name may be glorified.'}

You are the Good Shepherd, Who came in search of the wandering sheep. You give consolation to the fainthearted, and life to the brokenÂ­hearted. You healed the hemorrhage of the woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, and freed the daughter of the Canaanite woman from the cruel demon. You remitted the debt of the two debtors and forgave the sinful woman. You healed the Paralytic and forgave his sins. You justified the Publican with Your word, and received the Robber at his last confession. You took upon Yourself the sins of the world, by being nailed to the Cross. We pray to You and entreat You, O God; in Your goodness, loose, remit, and forgive the sins and transgressions of Your servants, both voluntary and involuntary, in knowledge and in ignorance, trespass and disobedience, at night and during the day; whether they be under the curse of a priest or a parent; whether they feasted their eyes, indulged their sense of smell, touched and gratified themselves, or tasted fornication; or through whatever impulse of the flesh and of the spirit they have alienated themselves from Your will, and from Your holiness. Forgive whatever sins they or we have committed; for You are a good God, Who remembers not evil, and loves mankind, permitting us not to fall into the unclean life, neither to follow in wayward paths. Yes, Lord and Master, hear me, a sinner, in this hour, on behalf of these Your servants. Overlook all their trespasses, as a forgiving God. Deliver them from eternal punishment; fill their mouths with praise of You; open their lips that they may glorify Your holy name; stretch forth their hands to perform Your commandments. Direct their feet aright, in the way of Your Gospel, strengthening all their members and their thoughts by Your grace. For You are our God, Who through Your holy Apostles gave us a commandÂ­ment saying: "Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in Heaven." And again: "If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained." And as You hearkened to Hezekiah in the sorrow of his soul, at the hour of his death, and did not overlook his prayer, in like manner hear me, Your humble, sinful and unworthy servant, praying to You at this hour. For You are the Lord, Jesus Christ, Who in Your mercy and love for mankind commanded us to forgive those who fall into sin, even seventy times seven; Who laments over our wickedness, and rejoices over the return of those who have strayed.

For You, O Lord, in the Old Testament, ordained repentance for sinners: for David and the Ninevites, and for those before and after them. But also in the new dispensation of Your coming in the flesh, You called not the righteous but the sinners to repentance; like the publican, the harlot, the robber, and the blasphemer and great persecutor Paul, receiving them all through repentance. Peter, Your great Apostle who denied You three times, You received in repentance, and promised him, saying: "You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it; and I will give You the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven." Therefore, O merciful and loving God, encouraged by Your faithful promise, we pray and entreat You at this hour. Hear our prayer and accept it as incense offered to You.

And if they have transÂ­gressed Your commandments, or have erred, as bearing flesh and living in the world, or by the prompting of the devil, forgive them, as a merciful and loving God; for there is no man who lives and does not sin.
