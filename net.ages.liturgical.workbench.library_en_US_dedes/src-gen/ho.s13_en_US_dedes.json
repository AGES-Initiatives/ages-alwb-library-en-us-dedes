Give no place to the wicked demon to dominate me by taking over this mortal body of mine. Hold my wretched and feeble hand, and lead me on the way of salvation. Yes, holy Angel of God, guardian and protector of my wretched soul and body, forgive me everything that I have done to trouble you all the days of my life, and if I have sinned in anything today. Shelter me tonight, and preserve me from every prank of the enemy, that I may not anger God by any sin. Intercede with the Lord on my behalf, that He strengthen me in the fear of Him, and that He make me a worthy servant of His goodness. Amen.'}
