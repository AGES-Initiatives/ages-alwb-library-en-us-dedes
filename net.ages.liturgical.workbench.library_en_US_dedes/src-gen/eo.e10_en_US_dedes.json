Recognizing Him, * Peter sprang to meet Him. This was the third time * that He appeared to them, and showed * bread and fish on the charcoals.'}

So they went back to the boats and the nets, and there was no catch at all. But then, O Savior, when You appeared as the Master of all, You commanded them to cast the nets on the right side of the boat. They put Your word into action at once; and so great was the shoal of fish. Then, an unusual meal was ready for them ashore. That meal, which Your Disciples partook of then, grant us to enjoy now spiritually, O Lord who love humanity.'}
