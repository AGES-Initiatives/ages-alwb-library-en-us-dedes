He contended splendidly for Christ and the truth. He openly preached the Orthodox faith, and put an end to the error of idolatry. He rebuked the most unlawful king, and with joy and exultation he was beheaded. Therefore he received the crown from the right hand of the Most High, and he became a fellow citizen of the Angels. This is why the Orthodox Church venerates his all-honored skull, and crowns it with praises. By it she is freed from many hardships and diseases, and she praises the Maker of all with joy.'}
